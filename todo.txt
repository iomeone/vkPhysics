- Add proper colors to the chunks (get it to work over network) !!!
- Make sure that union color and array colors don't get mixed!!!
- Consider replacing SSAO with shadows
- Make sure that we store the initial value of the colors in case of prediction errors
- Optimise this and get rid of the 2 loops (game_packet.cpp: 202)
- Fix mess with calling UI code from scene code (e.g. whenever a spawn event triggers, don't clear game menu, etc...)
- Make sure that pressing unpause button doesn't trigger spawn event
- Make sure that resizing doesn't crash from UI code
- Add trees, etc...
