- Make it so that client removes all modifications until
  tick that server says does not contain any prediction errors
  (tick at which client sent commands)
- When server finds an error at a tick (tick of commands sending),
  it sends that to the client so that client can revert all modifications
  until that tick (included)
- Server sends all modifications that occured between game state dispatches
  so that client can interpolate between all modifications - except
  for the modifications that the client did.
- Only send modifications that client did in case client has done a prediction
  error (also, if the client had to do a voxel correction, just interpolate between
  all voxels after revert)

(+ = todo)
(- = done)
