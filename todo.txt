- Client needs to record all modifications for each chunk
- Make it so that client removes all modifications until
  tick that server says does not contain any prediction errors
- Migrate chunk error checking directly to when terraforming happens
  so that server can get the exact tick at which the client messed up
- Make it so that client also sends all modifications for each tick
- When server finds an error at a tick, it sends that to the client
  so that client can revert all modifications until that tick (included)
- Server sends all modifications that occured between game state dispatches
  so that client can interpolate between all modifications - except
  for the modifications that the client did.
- Only send modifications that client did in case client has done a prediction
  error (also, if the client had to do a voxel correction, just interpolate between
  all voxels after revert)

(+ = todo)
(- = done)
